# datastripes-canvas
Datastripes implemented with HTML5 canvas

The core idea of datastripes comes from Ramana Rao's [Table Lens](http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/publications/items/UIR-1994-07-Rao-CHI94-TableLens.pdf). Back in 2003 I implemented a version in C++ for the then-current Mac OS, but that hasn't worked for several years. More recently I reimplemented [datastripes in javascript](https://github.com/carlmanaster/datastripes) with d3.js.  This latest incarnation, still in javascript, uses HTML5 Canvas

See the [wiki](https://github.com/carlmanaster/datastripes-canvas/wiki/Datastripes) for how to use and interpret the charts.
